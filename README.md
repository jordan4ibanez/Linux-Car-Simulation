##Goals of this project
1. 2d car simulator 
2. car body and individual wheels simulated which affect the body
3. Realistic car physics, oversteer, understeer, tires breaking traction
4. different surfaces for the car to drive on 
5. road surface creation utility 
6. skid marks, smoke, effects
7. Light levels which affect the ability to see the course
8. Lights (head lights, fog lights, etc...)
 
##Beyond this project
1. 3d car simulator
2. eventually move it out of python into a faster more complex engine
