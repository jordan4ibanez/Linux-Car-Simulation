##Reason for this project
Linux has some great games, but the one thing I think it clearly lacks is a realistic driving simulation. All the driving simulations that I have tried on this platform are not up to snuff with what people would expect from a driving simulator. The goal of this project is to have a driving simulation which is realistic, open source, gplv2 and always free.

##Goals of this project (2D)
#1. 2d car simulator
2. car body and individual wheels simulated which affect the body
3. Realistic car physics, oversteer, understeer, tires breaking traction
4. different surfaces for the car to drive on 
5. road surface creation utility 
6. skid marks, smoke, effects
7. Light levels which affect the ability to see the course
8. Lights (head lights, fog lights, etc...)
9. Transmission (resistance, clutch, etc..) Engine (Horsepower, torque, heat, etc...) Suspension

##Optional:
1. Four Wheel Steering
 
##Beyond this project
1. 3d car simulator
2. eventually move it out of python into a faster more complex engine
